<p>Pig is a simple dice game where players take turns to roll a single dice as many times as they wish
, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.</p>
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":
<ul>
<li>
If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
</li>
<li>
If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
</li>
<li>
If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
</li>
<li>
The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the first player, Donald, begins a turn with a roll of 5. Donald could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 1, and must end his turn without scoring. The next player, Alexis, rolls the 
sequence 4-5-3-5-5, after which she chooses to hold, and adds her turn total of 22 points to her score.</p>
